Add theme selector logic 

add map component logic
link them to app.tsx and progressively build the project 


the app.tsx is the entry point for the application. setting up the structure 
here will make it easy to visualise where the themSelector and MapComponent will 
go later 


flow of logic:

app.tsx

- maintains the theme state
-renders <themSelector/> and <MapComponent/>, passing the them value and 
its updater

ThemeSelector.tsx:

- displays two radio buttons to let the user pick the theme.

- Updates the parent <App>'s theme state value after user event in child component.


MapComponent.tsx:

- renders the leadlet map using the tile layer matching the theme state value.

- the map updates automatically when the theme state in app changes
